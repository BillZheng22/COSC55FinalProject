# COSC 55 Final Project
Bill and Rohan's COSC 55 Final Project

Details for the Final Project are found in the Wiki portion of this GitHub Repo.

**Project Description:** 
"Securing Data in Transit with PKI" is a cloud security project aimed at ensuring secure data transmission within a cloud environment using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This solution leverages AWS services such as EC2, VPC, S3, IAM, and others to enable encrypted communication and robust access control.

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of PKI for secure data transmission.
- SSL/TLS certificates setup to encrypt data in transit.
- Deployment and configuration of AWS resources like VPC, EC2, S3, IAM.
- Security configurations, including Security Groups and IAM roles, adhering to the principle of least privilege.

**Installation Instructions:**
1. Prerequisites:
- AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- AWS CLI installed and configured on your local machine.
- Access to the project repository on GitHub.

2. Clone the Repository:
- Use git clone https://github.com/BillZheng22/COSC55FinalProject.git to clone the repository to your local environment.

3. Setup AWS Resources:
- Follow the steps outlined in the deployment_guide.md (to be created) to set up the necessary AWS infrastructure, including VPCs, EC2 instances, and Security Groups.

4. SSL/TLS Certificates Setup:
- Refer to the relevant section in the documentation for setting up and configuring SSL/TLS certificates.

5. Testing:
- After deployment, perform the necessary tests to ensure that all components are functioning as expected, including secure data transmission and access control.

**Code Documentation:**
Ensure all scripts and code are well-commented to explain their functionality. Maintain a consistent coding style across the project.
